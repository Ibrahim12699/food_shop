# Food Shop App

Welcome to the UI Challenge for the Flutter Food App! This challenge focuses on enhancing the user experience by incorporating engaging and fluid animations. The goal is to create a visually appealing and interactive interface that not only looks great but also provides smooth transitions and feedback to users.

## Animations

Vertical swipe with dynamic changes in the position and size of each element using the stack and animated positioning.
